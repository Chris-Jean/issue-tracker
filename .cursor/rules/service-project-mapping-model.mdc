# service-project-mapping-model

## Core Mapping System (Importance: 85/100)

The service-project mapping model implements comprehensive relationships between service numbers and corresponding project names through a structured mapping system in `/app/data/issueOptions.ts`. Key components include:

1. Service Number Association
- Direct mapping between service identifiers and project names
- Project name auto-population based on service selection
- Validation rules for service number formats

2. Client Categorization
- Hierarchical client classification system
- Service-to-client relationship mapping
- Client-specific project naming rules

3. Regional Naming Conventions
- Region-specific project identifiers
- Standardized naming patterns per geographic area
- Regional service number prefixes

## Integration Points (Importance: 75/100)

The mapping model integrates with the issue management system through:

1. Form Integration (`/app/IssueForm.tsx`)
- Automated project field population
- Service number validation
- Dynamic project name generation

2. Reason Code System
- Standardized issue classification codes
- Service-specific reason code mappings
- Regional reason code variations

## Language Support Matrix (Importance: 70/100)

The model includes language support functionality:
- Service-language compatibility mapping
- Region-specific language requirements
- Language-based project naming rules
- Initial supported language set definitions
