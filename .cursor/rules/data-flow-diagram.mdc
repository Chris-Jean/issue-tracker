Primary Data Flow Paths (Importance: 85/100)

```
[IssueForm.tsx] -> Service Number Input
    |
    ↓
[issueOptions.ts] -> Project Name Mapping
    |
    ↓
[IssueForm.tsx] -> Image Upload/Preview
    |
    ↓
[issues.ts] -> Archival Processing
    |
    ↓
[ArchivesPage.tsx] -> Analytics Processing
```

Key Data Transformations:

1. Service Number → Project Name Flow
```
Service Number Input → Mapping Logic → Project Name Population
    |
    ↓
Client Category Assignment
    |
    ↓
Regional Identifier Association
```

2. Issue Archive Flow
```
Active Issue → Two-Stage Deletion
    |
    ↓
Archive Status → Image Processing
    |
    ↓
Date Range Grouping → Batch Processing
```

3. Analytics Data Flow
```
Archived Issues → Monthly Aggregation
    |
    ↓
Category Grouping → Trend Analysis
    |
    ↓
Client Frequency → Language Distribution
```

Business-Specific Data Relationships:

1. Service-Project Mapping:
- Service numbers directly determine project assignments
- Regional identifiers influence project naming
- Client categories flow into reporting structure

2. Language Processing:
- User input → Language detection
- Language suggestion system → Support matrix
- Distribution patterns → Analytics

3. Archive Management:
- Active issues → Archive stage → Deletion
- Image data → Archive storage
- Date ranges → Batch operations
