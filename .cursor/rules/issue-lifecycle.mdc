# issue-lifecycle

Importance Score: 85/100

The issue lifecycle implements a strict multi-stage transition model with specialized business rules:

## State Transitions
1. Active → Archived → Deletable
- Issues must pass through archived state before deletion
- Soft-delete pattern maintains data integrity during transitions
- Custom archival workflow preserves complete issue history

## Archival Workflow
- Implements business-specific archival policies
- Maintains separate active/archived issue querying
- Historical issue tracking with date-range analysis
- Month-year grouping for archived records

## State Management Components

### Active State (app/IssueForm.tsx)
- Service number linkage validation
- Project name association checks
- Image documentation requirements

### Archived State (components/ArchivesPage.tsx)
- Client frequency analytics
- Reason pattern tracking
- Language distribution analysis
- Multi-parameter search system

### State Persistence (convex/issues.ts)
- Active/archived state management
- Custom filtering logic
- Historical data preservation
- Date-range querying system

## Business Rules
1. No direct deletion of active issues
2. Service number validation during state transitions
3. Mandatory archival period before deletion
4. Category hierarchy preservation across states
